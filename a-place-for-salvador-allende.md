# A Place for Salvador Allende: A Data Investigation

[Work in progress] Why are there more places named after Salvador Allende, president of Chile from 1970 to 1973, that are outside of Chile than inside Chile?


## Who am I and why am I doing this?

Full disclosure: I am not from Chile, I am not of Chilean descent, and I do not have any material connections with Chile.

However, I became interested in Chile because I used to be a data analyst working with publicly traded companies in Latin America. I also have a degree related to social sciences, which informs my approach towards this data investigation. 

Story time: Back when I was in my first year at university, a Chilean professor visited and gave a lecture on Chilean and Southeast Asian relations. I tried to take notes, but my academic interest at that time was clearly not Chilean affairs, so my notes ended up half-baked and I wrote the most controversial statement of 2015:

> Stable democracy (had an authoritarian gov't from 1960s to 1973)

I then finished university and got a job as a data analyst where one of the markets that we were working on is... Chile, so this time I had to be involved in Chilean affairs. Then The Pandemic came and instead of exploring the central business district around my workplace I had to stay at home. I had nothing much to do aside from clicking random Wikipedia links related to Chilean affairs. That's how I found out six years later that Chile, in fact, did NOT have an authoritarian government from 1960s to 1973. I got the years mixed up because there indeed was an authoritarian government after 1973, but before that the presidents were democratically elected. This included Salvador Allende, the last democratically elected president before 1973.

My social sciences-educated self genuinely appreciates all the efforts that the Chilean diaspora and their counterparts back home have made to keep Allende's memory alive despite active suppression from the authoritarian government and their allies. I've never seen a memorial effort as thoughtful, united and widespread as this one.

This project is my penance for perpetuating the sin of suggesting that Salvador Allende was authoritarian. Kidding aside, Chile's rough history from Allende onwards was something I didn't have notes of back in 2015 and which I had to find out myself several years later. I am not an expert on the matter; I am just someone who is interested in it and would like to contribute to the cause, to the best of my understanding and abilities.

I did say that I am not from Chile, I am not of Chilean descent, and I do not have any material connections with Chile. However, I still do have a personal connection towards Allende as a topic.

I got interested enough in the topic to be aware of the details of how Allende died, at least according to the 2011 autopsy. And then I spent a year (perhaps more) fighting my own suicidal thoughts. I eventually got therapy for them, and I decided that engaging further with someone who once [shared one's own suicidal thoughts two years before doing the act](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/12/archives/socialist-says-allendeonce-spoke-of-suicide.html) is enabling my own suicidal thoughts, so I dropped all my interest towards Allende and Chile at large for a while. If Allende was actually assassinated and no one disputed it, I wouldn't have needed to write this whole paragraph.

I planned to visit Chile this year during the 50th anniversary of the coup d'état where Allende died, but I ended up deciding that the money for the trip is better spent on physically and professionally improving myself as a form of mental health recovery. I only started this project when I felt that I was mentally prepared to go back to this interest—and here I am collecting all these places named after Allende while practicing Python, adding to my data science portfolio, and making sense of my thoughts about these topics. I plan to finish this project in time for the Chilean 9/11.


## Who was Salvador Allende?

⚠ **Content warning: this section contains references to suicide.**

[Wikipedia's summary of Allende's life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende) provides enough information without causing information overload, and I'll paste a good version of it here for everyone's convenience:

> Salvador Guillermo Allende Gossens (26 June 1908 – 11 September 1973) was a Chilean physician and socialist politician who served as the 28th president of Chile from 3 November 1970 until his death on 11 September 1973. He was the first Marxist to be elected president in a liberal democracy in Latin America.
> 
> Allende's involvement in Chilean politics spanned a period of nearly forty years, having covered the posts of senator, deputy and cabinet minister. As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile, whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. In 1970, he won the presidency as the candidate of the Popular Unity coalition, in a close three-way race. He was elected in a run-off by Congress, as no candidate had gained a majority.
> 
> As president, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education and improve the living standards of the working class. He clashed with the right-wing parties that controlled Congress and with the judiciary. On 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'état supported by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende died by suicide in his office.
> 
> Following Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta until 1990, ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance. The military junta that took over dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a program of persecuting alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.

The [Simple English version](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende) of Wikipedia's article on Allende works as a more accessible version, especially for those who are new to socialist discourse. Pardon this article's occasional repetitiveness to the point of being absurd because apparently "_some feel that he took his own life by committing suicide_".


## Why are places named after Salvador Allende?

When we talk about Salvador Allende, two things matter the most: _socialist_ and _democratically elected_. These two explain a lot about his presence around the world.

* Allende has been a socialist since his student days. As a socialist, he believed that the gap between the richest and the poorest people in Chile is unacceptable and this could be eliminated when resources like copper mines and institutions like hospitals are owned by the Chilean state rather than the private sector who also happen to be the richest people. He campaigned for the improvement of the lives of working-class people, and for that he got the support of a lot of them.
* Socialists around the world have their vocal (and wealthy) opponents, and Chilean socialists like Allende were no exception. This is why Allende had a hard time winning the presidential elections the first three times he tried. Back then, socialists became leaders of their own countries not through elections but through chaotic revolutions. Allende was convinced that he could avoid another chaotic revolution, so he ran again for the presidency in 1970. This time, he became the first democratically elected socialist leader in the world. When he became president, he established and maintained contact with other socialist leaders around the world who recognized that Allende was seeking the same goals as them (socialism) through different means (peaceful democratic processes).

Allende's presidency, which started peacefully in 1970, ended violently in 1973 with the coup led by Augusto Pinochet. The military leadership that took over the country refused to give him a state funeral that every deceased president deserves. A lot of Chileans, especially Allende's supporters, had to seek exile abroad to save themselves from the human rights violations done by Pinochet's military dictatorship. Allende effectively became a taboo topic during the dictatorship, and virtually no one in Chile was able to pay respects to the late president because they either had to escape from Chile or was already killed by the army.

Outside of Chile, I can identify three interest groups that have been naming and building things in honor of Salvador Allende:

### Chilean diaspora

These individuals appreciate Allende for defending the Chilean working class throughout his political career, and of course for having been the last democratically elected President of the Republic of Chile before the 1973 coup (arguably the most widely known, if not controversial, president of Chile).

When the Chilean state under Pinochet won't do the necessary honors for Allende, these Chileans will, from their respective countries of residence. And even after democracy has been restored in Chile, they continue to do the honors wherever they are in the world.

> The "Salvador-Allende-Weg" (Salvador Allende Path) was named after Salvador Allende, born in 1908 in Valparaíso, president of Chile, physician and co-founder of the Socialist Party of Chile. Allende died on 11 September 1973 in Santiago de Chile during the takeover of the presidential palace by the coup plotters. This path on the Danube Park was built with support from Chilean workers (refugees).

> A physician and politician, Salvador Allende was president of Chile from 1970 to 1973. His mandate ended suddenly on 11 September 1973: a coup d’état led by Augusto Pinochet deposed his socialist government and installed a military dictatorship that lasted 17 years. The artwork is a reminder of the humanitarian and democratic values promoted by Allende. The tree, by its double roots, builds a bridge between the country of origin and Montréal as a land of welcome for the Chilean community.

### Socialists (regardless of whether they gained power through democratic means)

These individuals appreciate Allende for being a socialist who never softened his position despite fierce opposition.

Some socialist leaders have named and built places in honor of Allende and portrayed him as a martyr to further their own socialist agenda - see Cuba for example.

### Advocates of democracy (regardless of whether they're outwardly socialist or not)

These individuals appreciate Allende for believing in democratic institutions until the end.

I have yet to find out how socialists in France approached Allende relative to the former Soviet Socialist states, but look at all those 300+ streets named after Allende!

Inside Chile, Allende only got the historical recognition he deserved (including a state funeral) with the return of democracy in 1990.

This part would benefit from specific examples and we'll provide them as we scrape the web for those places.


## How did Salvador Allende die, really?

⚠ **Content warning: this section contains references to suicide and murder.**

You may have read that Allende "_took his own life by committing suicide_", but some monuments, plates and street signs say that he was killed by the coup plotters.

Allende himself hinted in his [speech during the coup](https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1973/september/11.htm) that this was going to be his last, and that he would be willing to sacrifice himself, though the manner of sacrifice was vague.

> Given these facts, the only thing left for me is to say to workers: I am not going to resign! Placed in a historic transition, I will pay for loyalty to the people with my life.
> [...]
> Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! These are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain [...]

Wikipedia's article on the [death of Salvador Allende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Salvador_Allende) briefly explains the controversy and why Allende would be more inclined to kill himself instead of getting killed:

> Isabel Allende Bussi, the daughter of Salvador Allende and a former member of the Senate of Chile, stated that the Allende family had long accepted that the former president shot himself. She told the BBC, "The report conclusions [that Allende died by suicide] are consistent with what we already believed. When faced with extreme circumstances, he made the decision of taking his own life, instead of being humiliated."
> 
> Carlos Altamirano, who was close to Allende, recalls that prior to the coup, Allende would have dismissed his suggestion to seek refuge in a loyalist regiment and fight back from there. In Altamirano's words Allende also rejected the option "to do as so many dictators and presidents of Latin America, that is to grab a briefcase full of money and take a plane out the country." Allende was an admirer of José Manuel Balmaceda, a Chilean president who died by suicide in face of his defeat in the Chilean Civil War of 1891. According to Altamirano, Allende was "obsessed with the attitude of Balmaceda."

However, I think there are several reasons a lot of individuals found it easier to believe that Allende was murdered.
* The first people who announced that Allende had killed himself were the coup plotters. Why would Allende's supporters believe what their enemies were saying?
    * An actual exchange between Pinochet and Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal during the coup - 05:19 onwards in this [video from Memoria Chilena](http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/archivos2/videos/MC0043416.mpg):
        * Carvajal: [_in Spanish_] There is a communication from the infantry school staff who is already inside La Moneda, and due to the possibility of interception I will transmit it in English: [_in English, verbatim_] They say that Allende committed suicide and is dead now. [_in Spanish_] Tell me if you understood.
        * Pinochet: [_in Spanish_] Understood, perfectly understood. 
* Suicide can be interpreted as an acceptance of defeat and is highly contradictory to Allende's announcement in his last speech that he would not resign. Supporters would rather believe that Allende fought until the end.
* The exact method of Allende's suicide, which was only confirmed many years after the event, can come off as ridiculous or made-up to some individuals. 
    * Who else would shoot oneself with an AK-47? Which was held between the legs and under the chin? And which was a gift from none other than Fidel Castro of Cuba? This is too oddly specific. Allende being shot by enemies would be much easier to imagine, I suppose.
* Suicide is just taboo for some individuals, depending on their personal background.

Anecdotal evidence supporting suicide only came about after 1990, and an autopsy in 2011 confirmed it. Until then, Allende's supporters and others could only speculate about how he died, and the easiest reason was death in the hands of the enemies.

Right now, does believing that Allende died in his own hands make someone anti-Allende and pro-coup? Not necessarily, according to some witnesses of his death: 

> The other witnesses kept silent until after the restoration of democracy in Chile, as they believed (according to their own statements) that to corroborate the version of a suicide would in some measure downgrade Allende's sacrifice and lend support to the military regime.

With that said, it would be interesting to know which places claim murder and if any place ever acknowledged Allende's conscious, free-willed decision on that fateful day. We can create a new column which classifies (in an admittedly subjective manner) each place's stance on Allende's death:
* null  -   The place doesn't mention Allende's death
* -1    -   Explicitly mentions that Allende was murdered
* -0.5  -   Mentions Allende's death in a vague way, but suggests murder
* 0     -   Mentions Allende's death, but suggests neither murder nor suicide
* 0.5   -   Mentions Allende's death in a vague way, but suggests suicide
* 1     -   Explicitly mentions that Allende died by suicide

To make our lives easier, we can limit the scope of this column to rows in the main table with a populated `desc`.

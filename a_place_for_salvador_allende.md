# A Place for Salvador Allende: A Data Investigation

## [Work in progress]

This project seeks to make some sense out of the numerous places that contributors have made known through the website [_Una calle Salvador Allende_](http://www.abacq.org/calle/) ("_A Salvador Allende street_").

Individually, each place has their own story, but when taken together they reveal some insights on where and how Salvador Allende is commemorated around the world. Overall, these places don't just tell something about Allende, but also the people who made these places possible.

⚠ **Content warning: Throughout this investigation there will be references to sensitive topics, including violent means of death. Content warnings like this are provided before the specific sections that refer to these sensitive topics.**

## Who was Salvador Allende and why are places named after him?

First, some notes on the name:

* For English speakers who haven't heard of the name, "Allende" is pronounced like `ah-YEN-deh`.
* Salvador Allende sometimes appears as "**Salvador Allende Gossens**" or "Salvador Allende G." because of naming customs in Spanish-speaking regions like Chile.
  * People in Spanish-speaking regions have two surnames.
  * The first one ("Allende") comes from the father's surname at birth. It's the more commonly used surname and people in Spanish-speaking regions are usually called by their first surname ("Dr. Allende").
  * The second one ("Gossens") comes from the mother's surname at birth. It's not as important as the first surname in daily life. If it is used at all, it's often used along with the first surname for the sake of formality, or to distinguish people with the same given name and first surname. It's also often abbreviated if someone chooses to include it in a name.
  * Because the second surname is the last "word" in a Spanish full name, people who aren't familiar with Spanish naming customs would mistake it for the surname which someone should be called, but in reality people with second surnames are usually not called by their second surnames ("~~Dr. Gossens~~").

Salvador Allende's biography in [Memoria Chilena](https://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-799.html) aptly begins with:

> Salvador Allende was the president who attempted to establish socialism in Chile through democratic means.

An English translation of this biography is available [here](texts/salvador_allende_gossens_memoria_chilena_en.md) for those who are looking for a concise biography from a Chilean source. [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende) itself also works too and people can take advantage of the sources used in this article. There is also an equivalent article in the underrated [Simple English version](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende) of Wikipedia that is written in a way that those unfamiliar with politics would understand.

### Socialist, democratic, Chilean

Instead of writing yet another biography, this introduction focuses on these three key features of Allende.

* **Socialist**: Allende has been a socialist since his student days. As a socialist, he believed that the gap between the poor and the rich in Chile is unacceptable and this could be eliminated when resources like copper mines and institutions like hospitals are owned by the Chilean state rather than the private sector who also happen to be the richest people. He campaigned for the improvement of the lives of working-class people, and for that he got the support of a lot of them.

* **Democratic**: Socialists around the world have their vocal, wealthy, privileged, and powerful opponents; Chilean socialists like Allende were no exception. This is why Allende had a hard time winning the presidential elections the first three times he tried. Back then, socialists became leaders of their own countries not through elections but through chaotic revolutions. Allende was convinced that he could avoid another chaotic revolution, so he ran again for the presidency in 1970. This time, he became the first democratically elected socialist president in Chile. When he became president, he established and maintained contact with other socialist leaders around the world who recognized that Allende was seeking the same goals as them (socialism) through different means (peaceful democratic processes).

* **Chilean**: Chilean history isn't discussed in a lot of places outside of Chile, like schools and online forums, because what most people call "world history" is actually the history of Europe and the USA. We cannot talk about world history without taking lessons from lesser known countries like Chile. I feel the need to emphasize that Allende was Chilean, because he attempted to make Chilean history from a Chilean perspective and for the benefit of the Chilean people. Non-Chilean (lamentably, privileged American) forces disrupted Chilean history for the worse in an attempt to assert their own version of history, so it is up to Chileans and their sympathizers to reclaim Chilean history and make it part of world history.

### A violent end to a peaceful government

Allende's presidency, which started peacefully in 3 November 1970, ended violently in 11 September 1973 with the [US-backed coup d'état](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) led by Augusto Pinochet. Instead of resigning as demanded by the coup leaders or taking offers of safe passage to escape the coup alive, Allende delivered his last words to the public and chose to remain in the presidential palace, in the middle of gunshots and explosions, to die as President of Chile.

The military dictatorship that took over the country refused to give him a state funeral that every deceased president deserves. A lot of Chileans, especially Allende's supporters, had to seek exile abroad to save themselves from the human rights violations committed by Pinochet's military dictatorship throughout its rule.

Allende effectively became a taboo topic during the dictatorship, and virtually no one in Chile was able to pay respects to the late president because they either had to escape from Chile or was already killed by accomplices to the dictatorship.

### Long overdue respects

In 1988, Chileans voted against continuing on with a military government in a [historic referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Chilean_national_plebiscite), and in 1990 the country elected its [first democratically elected president in almost two decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricio_Aylwin). This year, the time was finally right to hold the [state funeral for Allende](https://twitter.com/LaChileanWay/status/1674960526214852608), but some Chileans still thought it wasn't deserved.

Regardless of when or whether the state funeral was held, many people have taken initiatives to pay respects to Allende as soon as after his death. This project proves that most of the initiatives come from outside of Chile thanks to the following interest groups.

## Who are naming places after Salvador Allende?

Outside of Chile, I can identify three interest groups that have been naming and building things in honor of Salvador Allende: socialists, democrats, and Chileans. All three reflect who Allende was, but each interest group has their own reasons to honor Allende, which in turn reflects who they are (or who they think they are).

Notes about images:

* Images used throughout this project come from the file category ["Monuments and memorials to Salvador Allende"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Monuments_and_memorials_to_Salvador_Allende) at Wikimedia Commons, an underrated source of free-to-use files. Each file contains a description in English and/or other languages, which helps provide context to the file and this project.
* To minimize copyrighted content in this [free-to-use](/LICENSE) [repository](/MIT_License.txt), there are links to each place with photos and details (usually in Spanish, the main language used in _Una calle Salvador Allende_).

### Socialists (regardless of whether they uphold peaceful democratic values or not)

Although socialist-aligned leaders around the world share the same goals, they differ in their means to achieve them. The means used throughout history had been unpleasant, and this is where Allende wanted to differ. There are brief historical information about each example country to compare them to the peaceful and democratic way in which Allende pursued socialist goals.

#### **Former Soviet Russia (and the Soviet Union)**

_[[ID 172](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2008/06/30/214-moscu-rusia)] улица Сальвадора Альенде / ulitsa Sal'vadora Al'yende at Moscow, Russia_

[Soviet Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic) was the center of the former Soviet Union, and Moscow was the capital of both Soviet Russia and Soviet Union. In 1973, Soviet Russian public organizations recommended to rename Moscow's 7th Sandy Street (7-я Песчаная улица) to [Salvador Allende Street](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ru:%D0%A3%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B0%20%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%20%D0%90%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B5?uselang=en). This street still carries Allende's name today, and the original memorial plate located at 1 Salvador Allende Street still remains as of May 2021 according to [Google Street View](https://goo.gl/maps/FtSoreDJD2VpteQL6).

Soviet Russia was established after the end of the Russian Empire and an armed revolution in 1917 that overthrew the short-lived provisional government that sought to follow. It became the world's first constitutionally socialist state. Opposition forces armed themselves against the revolution leaders, so the revolution escalated into a civil war. To win the civil war, Soviet Russia took most territories that belonged to the former Russian Empire, turned them into their own "independent" states, and grouped Soviet Russia and these states into the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union).

The economy of the Soviet Union was highly centralized and state-planned. Its economy progressed to the detriment of laborers in the union's extensive forced labor camps. One of Soviet Union's leaders, Joseph Stalin, implemented a Great Purge to eliminate political opponents and anyone else who was a threat to his power, to the point of literally erasing them out of photos with Stalin (see a sample photo [before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nikolai_Yezhov_with_Stalin_and_Molotov_along_the_Volga%E2%80%93Don_Canal,_orignal.jpg) and [after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stalin_and_Molotov_along_the_Volga%E2%80%93Don_Canal,_Nikolai_Yezhov_removed.jpg) the purge).

The Soviet Union and its allied countries were the representative of socialism and communism during the Cold War, which was not an armed war in itself but rather a series of competitions between socialist/communist interests and capitalist interests represented by the USA and its Western allies. Allende's government saw itself stuck in this political climate—the USA saw the socialist tendency of Allende's government as a threat to its interests, hence one of the "competitions" of the Cold War was fought in Chile.

Government-led reform within Soviet Russia (in an effort to save its economic and political system), separatist movements within the Soviet Union, and the overthrow of socialist/communist one-party governments in the Soviet Union's allied countries led to the Soviet Union's dissolution. Capitalist interests won in the Cold War, but not without violent means to suppress perceived threats such as Allende's government.

#### **Former East Germany**

Residents of the workers' quarters in Berlin-Köpenick, which was then part of East Germany, voted to name two intersecting streets after Salvador Allende and [Pablo Neruda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Neruda), a Chilean poet, Nobel Prize laureate, and important ally of Allende who died a few days after the coup d'état. The street names were officially given on 3 November 1973, which would have marked three years since Allende took office as president.

[East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany) existed from 1949 to 1990 and was a one-party state founded and governed by a socialist-aligned political party. When faced with an increasing number of skilled people leaving the country and weakening the economy, the government responded with building the Berlin Wall and violent means to keep people inside the country: landmines and traps were built around the wall, and border guards either killed people attemtpting to leave or captured them as long-term prisoners.

Peaceful protests influenced the fall of the Berlin Wall, multi-party free and fair elections in East German states, the reunification of East Germany and West Germany into today's Germany, and the prosecution of former East German leaders for crimes against their own people.

#### **Hungary**

_[[ID 157](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2009/07/15/363-budapest-hungria)] Salvador Allende memorial stone located within a park with the same name at Budapest, Hungary ([Photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Salvador_Allende-eml%C3%A9kk%C5%91,_2018_Kelenf%C3%B6ld.jpg) by Globetrotter19, CC BY-SA 3.0)_

![Photo of the Salvador Allende memorial stone at Budapest, Hungary - translated text of memorial stone follows.](assets/157_Hungary_Budapest_Salvador-Allende-eml%C3%A9kk%C5%91.jpg)

> Dr. Salvador Allende
>
> 1908 - 1973
>
> In memory of the President of the Republic of Chile, who died a martyr's death in the struggle for the socialist rise of his people
>
> Erected by the Budapest City Council
>
> 1973

The Budapest City Council approved the erection of this memorial stone in 24 October 1973. The apartments around the [park](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Allende_park,_Budapest) were built in the early 1970's by the Hungarian Young Communist League, which was attached to the then ruling socialist-aligned party of Hungary which gained power by suppressing opposition parties.

[Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_People%27s_Republic) was a one-party state from 1949 to 1989 with tight control from the Soviet Union, which violently repressed a people's revolution in 1956, killed thousands of Hungarians, and forced thousands more into exile.

The new goverment which the Soviet Union installed after the revolution grew to become less restrictive of people's freedoms and more welcoming of products from outside the Soviet Union, though the country remained a one-party Soviet-aligned state. This context made it easier for Hungary to transition into multi-party democracy after the Soviet Union's dissolution. To mark this transition, the country symbolically reburied the victims of the 1956 revolution in June 1989.

#### **Cuba**

_[[ID 132](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2011/08/23/530-la-habana-cuba)] Avenida Salvador Allende at Havana, Cuba_

_[[ID 129]((http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2007/07/17/90-monumento-a-salvador-allende-cuba))] Monument to Salvador Allende by Mónica Bunster at Havana, Cuba_

In Havana, capital of Cuba, Avenida Carlos III was renamed to Avenida Salvador Allende in October 1973, though [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/23860167) and [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/CfjwCeYfvvFJM6jg9) show both names to refer to the same avenue.

Nearby, there is a monument to Salvador Allende located at a park in Calle 23 corner Calle G (a.k.a. Avenida de los Presidentes). This monument was inaugurated in 2000 and is one of the four replicas of the original monument by Chilean artist Mónica Bunster located at Palmilla, Chile [[ID 25](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2008/07/01/216-la-palmilla-chile)]. It is a half-body bust of Allende wearing a professional suit without a tie, looking up and waving the right hand up high.

The other three replicas are in Castuera, Spain [[ID 357](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2007/09/11/93-castuera-espana)]; Gijón, Spain [[ID 360](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2007/03/21/63-gijon-espana)]; and at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico [[ID 213](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2007/02/18/43-universidad-de-guadalajara)], where Allende spoke the following quote in front of students on 2 December 1972.

> Being young and not being revolutionary is a contradiction at a biological level.

As for [Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba), it is currently one of the few remaining one-party socialist states in the world. The current government gained power through an elaborate armed revolution that lasted from 1953 to 1959. The revolution's leader, Fidel Castro, set himself up as the country's leader. Castro implemented a planned economy and nationalized industries according to socialist goals, but also banned political opposition and took full control of the press such that practically all news and information in Cuba comes from the one-party government.

Allende's government (re)established diplomatic relations with Cuba, a strong ally despite the differences in the means to achieve socialism. Castro held an official visit to Chile in 1971, and Allende held an official visit to Cuba in 1972. History says that Castro gifted Allende an AK-47 rifle; this rifle would become relevant in another section of this investigation.

### Advocates of democracy (regardless of whether they're outwardly socialist or not)

There has always been a significant opposition against socialist movements because historical socialist governments like the ones previously mentioned have been associated with violent forms of gaining and maintaining power, coercive measures such as forced labor that disrespect human autonomy, the suppression of all forms of opposition and criticism including well-meaning ones, and the suppression of human freedoms such as the right to migrate.

Allende was a socialist politician who gained power through free and fair elections (even if it took him four times) and maintained power without suppressing opposition, criticism, or human freedoms. However, his government was violently overthrown by forces who failed to disassociate Allende from the oppressive socialist governments in other countries.

Making such disassociation allows advocates of democracy, socialist or otherwise, to honor Allende as a faithful servant of citizen-led democracy and to condemn violence as a means to suppress opposition and perceived threats.

#### **France**

France's national foreign policy during Allende's presidency was unremarkable in the context of this investigation, because [its government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Pompidou) sought to maintain independence through its relations with both the Soviet Union and the USA. France would also elect a [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand) from its Socialist Party only in 1981.

In this context, the existence of numerous places in France named after Allende is better explained by efforts at the municipal level, depending on whether a municipal government is socialist-aligned, honoring Allende's democratic efforts, condemning the violent coup that overthrew Allende, and/or sympathetic towards Chilean refugees who had to escape the military dictatorship that followed the coup.

_[[ID 717](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2008/11/05/281-argenteuil-francia)] Esplanade Salvador Allende at Argenteuil, France_

The place in the dataset that was named after Salvador Allende the earliest is located at Argenteuil, France, where the municipal council at that time unanimously agreed to name a street after Salvador Allende as early as three days after the coup. The official announcement (full text below) used an anti-imperialist and pro-worker tone that is commonly seen in socialist-aligned messages, but also mentioned the legal and democratic nature of Allende's socialist government.

> **A _President Salvador Allende_ Street in Argenteuil**
>
> A military coup had just deposed the legal Popular Unity government in Chile.
>
> Reactionary forces with the help of multinational copper and telephone companies, supported by United States imperialism, violated the legality, suppressed liberties, and provoked a civil war to reclaim their privileges.
>
> A bloody repression arises over the democratic workers' movement.
>
> There are already thousands of victims.
>
> One of the first victims was the President of the Republic Salvador Allende.
>
> The Municipal Council in its public session on 14 September 1973 gave a respectful tribute to this brave and determined militant who died in combat and who will remain the symbol of Popular Unity.
>
> To immortalize his memory and highlight the solidarity of the inhabitants of Argenteuil towards the people of Chile, the Municipal Council unanimously decided to name the new street in the city center, which connects Rue de la Liberté to Rue du 8 Mai 1945, after President Salvador Allende.

Not all places in France named after Salvador Allende kept the name, and the main factor is, ironically but expectedly, driven by routine democratic elections at the municipal level. After winning elections, some right-wing anti-socialist municipal governments took out Allende's name from streets, parks, and other public spaces. One right-wing municipal mayor even [justified](http://www.abacq.org/calle/index.php?2007/02/18/4-levallois-perret-francia) the renaming of a street from Salvador Allende to another name by saying "Pinochet saved Chile from chaos".

Among those places that kept Salvador Allende's name, there is often an emphasis on Allende's death for the sake of democracy and/or socialism, in the face of fascist adversaries who chose to fight with violence. The portrayal of Allende's death is typically dramatic, if not graphic, to evoke the idea of martyrdom.

The Salvador Allende Park at Barcelona was inaugurated in April 1985 and its primary feature used to be a fountain. Upon the initiative of Chilean residents in Barcelona, and to make the dedication to Allende more obvious, Chilean artist Lautaro Díaz created a bust of Allende made of bronze. The bust was installed in this park and was inaugurated on 11 September 1997 (25th anniversary of the coup) in the presence of Isabel Allende, one of Salvador Allende's children, as well as Chilean and Catalan representatives.

What binds Chilean and Catalan people together in solidarity is the date 11 September: for Chileans, this date is a symbol of Allende's democratic efforts towards economic independence, and for Catalans, this date is a symbol of their democratic efforts towards [national independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_movement).

While 11 September or 9/11 is best known worldwide as the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks in the US, this in itself is an example of _world_ history being defined exclusively by _US_ events from a _US_ perspective. The 1973 coup d'état in Chile happened way earlier than these terror attacks, is influenced by global political contexts, is symbolic of external disruptions to internal processes that have become a common theme across peoples (including Catalan people), and has long-lasting consequences and impact. Fifty years later, this event is still less known worldwide compared to the terror attacks in the US.

What is even less known is that 11 September also marks the national day of Catalonia, called locally as the "[Diada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_Catalonia)" (literally "Day"). On this day in 1714, after a year-long battle in Barcelona, the Catalan army lost to the army of King Philip V, and the Catalan institutional system and rights were replaced with Philip V's absolute rule in an attempt to unify Spain. Modern-day celebrations of the Diada involve offering flowers and respects to Catalan army members who fought in 1714 and rallies in favor of Catalonia's independence from Spain.

#### **Italy**

In a now-democratic country with a fascist dictator past, where the [original idea of fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism) was born, was influenced by Nazi Germany, and evolved into a state that legalized racism and disregarded individual freedoms for the sake of imperialist nationalism, it is not surprising to see memorials to Allende.

It has a street named after Allende (Via Allende) and as expected there is also a mural dedicated to Allende near the intersection of Corso Repubblica and Via Cavour.

> 11 September 1973. Chilean military fascists, supported by the [United States] CIA, carry out a coup d'état and bomb the presidential palace where President Salvador Allende is found.

The mural also quotes an excerpt—in its original Spanish language—from Allende's [last speech](https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1973/september/11.htm) delivered via radio from the La Moneda presidential palace at 9:10 am in the middle of the coup:

> Sigan ustedes sabiendo que, mucho más temprano que tarde, se abrirán las grandes alamedas por donde pase el hombre libre para construir una sociedad mejor.
>
> [Go forward knowing that, much sooner rather than later, the great avenues will open again where free people will walk through to construct a better society.]

Allende's pursuit of social justice through democratic means finds sympathy around the world, because respect for democracy and social justice is not exclusive to socialism. Rather, both should be expected from any government, local or national, regardless of political affiliation or lack thereof.

### Chilean community

Chileans are the most affected by Allende's efforts and the disruptions faced by his government.

When the Chilean state under Pinochet was not willing to do the necessary honors for Allende, these Chileans did, from their respective countries of residence. And even after democracy had been restored in Chile, they continue to do the honors wherever they are in the world.

To achieve this, they come together as a community and collaborate with local governments and society groups to make commemorative spaces for Allende.

#### **Chileans in Chile**

The examples so far make it look like Allende is only commemorated outside of Chile—this was true during the dictatorship. Chileans inside Chile had to wait for the end of the dictatorship to be able to dedicate public spaces to Allende.

_[[ID 102](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_de_la_Solidaridad_Salvador_Allende)] Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende at Barrio República, Santiago, Chile_

This contemporary art museum seems to not have been mentioned in any post in "Una calle Salvador Allende", but deserves to be mentioned because it lived alongside Allende himself and is a perfect example of exile and coming back home experienced in Chilean history.

A Spanish art critic proposed a project to establish a museum in support of Allende's government. Allende approved this proposal, then wrote an open letter to artists around the world calling for artistic donations in all forms. He officially inaugurated the museum on 17 May 1972—at the time, it was named "Museo de la Solidaridad" ("Museum of Solidarity").

![A casually taken photo of Salvador Allende hanging at the entrance of the Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende.

> "On behalf of the people and the government of Chile, I extend my emotional gratitude to the artists who have donated their works to build the foundation of the future Museum of Solidarity. It is undoubtedly an exceptional event, which inaugurates an unprecedented type of relationship between creators and the public."
>
> Letter from Salvador Allende to the artists of the world, Santiago, 1972

After the 1973 coup and the installation of the dictatorship, the museum closed and its art, artists and managers went into exile outside Chile. A group of artists organized a roving museum from their places of exile, continued accepting art donations, and organized exhibitions all around Europe to denounce human rights violations during the dictatorship.

The museum was officially reestablished on September 1991, a year after the end of dictatorship in Chile, under its current name. It has since recovered its art collection from the 1970s, received new art donations, and currently houses some of Allende's personal objects, some of which are shown below:

* Doctor's cape
* Presidential sash and a copy of Allende's 1939 work _La realidad médico social chilena_ (_The Chilean medico-social reality_)
* Socialist Party membership card, watch, wallet, and an unidentifiable long brown object bearing his initials S.A.G.

The Congress of Chile approved a law in 1994 which said that three monuments in honor of Allende shall be built in Punta Arenas, Valparaíso, and Santiago. This [monument in Santiago](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumento_a_Salvador_Allende_(Santiago_de_Chile)) by Arturo Hevia was inaugurated on 26 June 2000 and stands just outside of the La Moneda Palace, where Allende died in 1973, as well as the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights of Chile. Due to its symbolic location, this monument serves as a [focal point](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Monumento_a_Salvador_Allende,_Santiago_de_Chile) where supporters do floral offerings and demonstrations to commemorate Allende's death and protest against human rights violations.

Another focal point of commemorations is [Morandé 80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morand%C3%A9_80), the address of one of La Moneda's doors which is only a few steps away from the monument to Allende.

![Flowers being offered right in front of Morandé 80 on 11 September 2009.](assets/0_Chile_Santiago_Morande-80.jpg)

When Presidents of Chile used to live in La Moneda, Morandé 80 was a convenient backdoor for the President to be able to enter and leave the palace without time-consuming formalities. Symbolically speaking, the President of Chile enters and leaves this door as a common citizen, like other common Chileans who enter and leave their doors of residence. After 1958, Presidents don't live in La Moneda anymore.

What used to be a mundane backdoor became a historically significant door when Salvador Allende's dead body was taken out of Morandé 80 after the 1973 coup. Symbolically speaking, the President who wished to die as President was taken out of La Moneda as a common citizen. During the reconstruction of La Moneda after the coup, the door of Morandé 80 and the room where Allende died were [sealed off into disappearance](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palacio_de_La_Moneda) to avoid them becoming symbols of Allende. The door and room were restored 30 and 35 years after the coup, respectively.

![Monument to Salvador Allende at Rancagua, O'Higgins Region, Chile - description follows.](assets/14_Chile_Rancagua_Monumento-Salvador-Allende.jpg)

The bust of Allende by sculptor Gregorio Berchenko is made of copper, the same resource that Allende nationalized to assert Chile's economic independence, much to the hostile reaction of the US government and businesses from whom the copper mines were taken.

The bust is framed within a white quadrilateral pillar that stands alongside two others. The pillar on the viewer's right has a large star drilled onto its upper half. The pillar on the right looks empty, but the article at _Una calle Salvador Allende_ says that it contains an excerpt from Allende's last speech. The star, the different textures across the three pillars, and the subtle line that divides the upper and lower parts of the pillars evoke the image of the flag of Chile. This monument was inaugurated on January 2009.

One of the more recent memorials to Allende (relative to other memorials in the dataset with known dates of establishment) was unveiled on 26 June 2011. This sculpture by Oscar Plandiura quotes the most from Allende's last speech—there are nine paragraphs of quotation inscribed on this high monument, excluding the title, location and date of the speech. Even from afar, it already looks like a long read despite not being the full speech. Those who would like to read the full speech are advised to read this [English translation that comes with the original Spanish recording](https://www.marxists.org/archive/allende/1973/september/11.htm). (Be warned that the recording is suddenly very loud and startling at the end, but it is part of the violent background and emotional intent of Allende's last speech.)

## [Data investigation proper: insert charts here]

### How did Salvador Allende die, really?

⚠ **Content warning: this section contains references to suicide and murder.**

Some memorials to Allende say that he was killed by the coup plotters, and at least one memorial disagrees with this version of events. Rather than elaborate on both death versions, this investigation seeks to explain at a psychological level why people would believe one death version over another.

Allende hinted in his speech during the coup that this was going to be his last, and that he would be willing to sacrifice himself, though the manner of sacrifice was vague.

> Given these facts, the only thing left for me is to say to workers: I am not going to resign! Placed in a historic transition, I will pay for loyalty to the people with my life.
>
> [...]
>
> Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! These are my last words, and I am certain that my sacrifice will not be in vain [...]

There could be several reasons a lot of individuals found it easier to believe that Allende was killed.

* The first people who announced that Allende had killed himself were the coup plotters. Why would Allende's supporters believe what their enemies were saying?
  * An actual exchange between Pinochet and Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal during the coup - 05:19 onwards in this [video from Memoria Chilena](http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/archivos2/videos/MC0043416.mpg):
    * > Carvajal: [_in Spanish_] There is a communication from the infantry school staff who is already inside La Moneda, and due to the possibility of interception I will transmit it in English: [_word-for-word_] They say that Allende committed suicide and is dead now. [_in Spanish_] Tell me if you understood.
    * > Pinochet: [_in Spanish_] Understood, perfectly understood.
* Suicide can be interpreted as an acceptance of defeat and is highly contradictory to Allende's announcement in his last speech that he would not resign. Supporters would rather believe that Allende fought until the end.
* The exact method of Allende's suicide, at least according to the autopsies, can come off as ridiculous or made-up to some individuals.
  * Who else would shoot oneself with an AK-47? Which was held between the legs and under the chin? And which was a gift from none other than Fidel Castro of Cuba? This is too oddly specific. Allende being shot by enemies would be much easier to imagine, perhaps.
* Suicide is just taboo for some individuals, depending on their personal background.

Anecdotal evidence supporting suicide only came about after the return of democracy in Chile, and an autopsy in 2011 sought to add further details onto it. Until then, Allende's supporters and others could only speculate about how he died, and the easiest reason was death in the hands of the enemies.

Right now, does believing that Allende died in his own hands make someone anti-Allende and pro-coup? Not necessarily, according to [some witnesses to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Salvador_Allende):

> The other witnesses kept silent until after the restoration of democracy in Chile, as they believed (according to their own statements) that to corroborate the version of a suicide would in some measure downgrade Allende's sacrifice and lend support to the military regime.

## Who am I anyway and why am I doing this?

Full disclosure: I am not from Chile, I am not of Chilean descent, and I do not have any material connections with Chile.

However, I became interested in Chile because I used to be a data analyst working with publicly traded companies in Latin America. I also have a degree related to social sciences, which informs my approach towards this data investigation.

Story time: Back when I was in my first year at university, a Chilean professor visited and gave a lecture on Chilean and Southeast Asian relations. I tried to take notes, but my academic interest at that time was clearly not Chilean affairs, so my notes ended up half-baked and I wrote the most controversial statement of 2015:

> Stable democracy (had an authoritarian gov't from 1960s to 1973)

I then finished university and got a job as a data analyst where one of the markets that we were working on is... Chile, so this time I had to be involved in Chilean affairs. Then The Pandemic came and instead of exploring the central business district around my workplace I had to stay at home. I had nothing much to do aside from clicking random Wikipedia links related to Chilean affairs. That's how I found out six years later that Chile, in fact, did NOT have an authoritarian government from 1960s to 1973. I got the years mixed up because there indeed was an authoritarian government after 1973, but before that the presidents were democratically elected. This included Salvador Allende, the last democratically elected president before 1973.

My social sciences-educated self genuinely appreciates all the efforts that the Chilean diaspora and their counterparts back home have made to keep Allende's memory alive despite active suppression from the authoritarian government and their allies. I've never seen a memorial effort as thoughtful, united and widespread as this one.

This project is my penance for perpetuating the sin of suggesting that Salvador Allende was authoritarian. Kidding aside, Chile's rough history from Allende onwards was something I didn't have notes of back in 2015 and which I had to find out myself several years later. I am not an expert on the matter; I am just someone who is interested in it and would like to contribute to the cause, to the best of my understanding and abilities.

⚠ **Content warning: this section contains references to suicide.**

I did say that I am not from Chile, I am not of Chilean descent, and I do not have any material connections with Chile. However, I still do have a personal connection towards Allende as a topic.

I got interested enough in the topic to be aware of the details of how Allende died, at least according to the 2011 autopsy. And then I spent a year (perhaps more) fighting my own suicidal thoughts. I eventually got therapy for them, and I decided that engaging further with someone who once [shared his own suicidal thoughts two years before doing the act](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/12/archives/socialist-says-allendeonce-spoke-of-suicide.html) is enabling my own suicidal thoughts, so I dropped all my interest towards Allende and Chile at large for a while. If Allende was actually assassinated and no one disputed it, I wouldn't have needed to write this whole paragraph.

I planned to visit Chile this year during the 50th anniversary of the coup d'état where Allende died, but I ended up deciding that the money for the trip is better spent on physically and professionally improving myself as a form of mental health recovery. I only started this project when I felt that I was mentally prepared to go back to this interest—and here I am collecting all these places named after Allende while practicing Python, adding to my data science portfolio, and making sense of my thoughts about these topics. I plan to finish this project in time for the Chilean 9/11.
